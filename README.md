Studios Enhanced Flask Web Application

Autumn 2023 Session


I have removed the database credentials from the .env file for security and connection purposes as it will be published to a public repository.  

Please find the database credentials in Appendix 5 of the report and follow instructions.

If after downloading the files there is no .env file present, you may need to create one.  


Additionally for testing, you will need to download various python libraries. These include: 
 
    pip install --upgrade pip 

    pip install mysqlclient 

    pip install Flask 

    pip install Flask-MySQLdb  

    pip install Flask-WTF 

    pip install mysql-connector-python 


Please find the MySQL database SQL code in the sql.txt file.
